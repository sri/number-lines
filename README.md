Initial impressions
===================

This is a test plugin to explore Github's new Atom.io's plugin system.
Parts of this project were copied from the sort-lines package:
https://github.com/atom/sort-lines

I've written multiple plugins for both GNU Emacs and Sublime Text,
so I understand what it takes to write them. Here are some thoughts
about my first Atom plugin:

* Wow, this was easy and fun to write!!
* Coffeescript seems to be a great language to write plugins in.
* Everything is so streamlined: from generating a plugin package
  (Generate Package) to loading it into the system (Window Reload)
  to writing the specs for it and running it (Run Package Specs)!!
* The range-finder.coffee that I had to copy over from the sort-line
  package is unfortunate. Seem like that functionality should be build
  into Atom itself...(maybe I'm missing something there).
* That plugins comes with specs is really awesome!!

Overall, I'm highly impressed.
